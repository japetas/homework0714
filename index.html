		<p>With cap space teams like the Brooklyn Nets, Atlanta Hawks and Chicago Bulls making moves, it appears as though the Oklahoma City Thunder will be unable to trade away the contract of Carmelo Anthony.

The Thunder would have to attach multiple assets to Anthony to incentivize a team to take on his $28 million salary.

"At some point here, it is expected they'll do a waive-and-stretch on Carmelo Anthony," said Adrian Wojnarowski.

The Thunder will receive significant luxury tax savings by using the stretch provision on Anthony.

Anthony is widely expected to sign with the Houston Rockets when he becomes a free agent. Poor Rockets team, unfortunately, never gonna win a championship.
		</p>
		<p>The Chicago Bulls and Jabari Parker are progressing towards an offer sheet.

The two sides are still discussing a number of topics.

Parker is a restricted free agent, which gives the Milwaukee Bucks matching rights.
